								<p> HBC722 might just seem like a random string of characters to most people, but to me, the name will forever conjure up a strong sense of nostalgia, being the focus of my first ever research project. You never forget your first, and I sure remember mine like it was yesterday: a 19 year old freshman Zach, still running off the adrenaline from traveling across 12 timezones, with a questionable haircut and even worse fashion sense. Indeed, without this little ball of fusion located around 2600 light years from Earth, who knows what I would be doing today (personally I think I'd make a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_mourning" target="_blank">professional mourner</a> &#128557;)
                                </p>

                                <h3>But what is HBC722 exactly?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The short answer: a young star that behaves quite peculiarly; the long answer? Well, that requires us to first understand a little bit about how stars are born.
                                </p>

                                        Space is empty, like REALLY empty, like your-local-Domino's-dine-in-section-empty (I can't remember the last time I sat down at a Domino's). However, every so often, you run into regions of space filled with clouds of gas and dust; enriched by the remnants of stars that are long dead. These large molecular clouds are filled to the brim with hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of other heavier elements. Poetically, these burial sites for stars of times past, are also the forming grounds for stars of times yet to come. In fact, our own Sun most likely emerged from one such location, many many moons ago.

                                        Within these turbulent clouds exist dense regions, delicately held together by gravity and other forces. There, we start to form the nucleus of what is to become a full-fledged star, so called "prestellar cores". Like a baby bird that's yet to leave its nest, relying on its mother to sustain itself, these prestellar cores are not yet able to produce their own light via nuclear fusion (like our own Sun does), but instead derive their power from the surrounding material that's constantly being sucked into it (via gravity). To visualize this, think of dropping a really heavy book on the ground, which creats a loud <i>thud</i>, except now you're dropping tons of matter onto a core, and creating a bright <i>shine</i>. 
										<br>
										<br>
										Eventually, with enough time and patience, all of the surrounding material is condensed into a single core, at which point it can graduate onto "adult" status, able to generate its own light via fusion, form planets, find a job, pay taxes, and complain about politics. In that sense, HBC722 is a "young" star in that it's still navigating through its awkward puberty stage (relatable).

									<h3>Did that make sense? </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Cool, because all of it is wrong! Okay, maybe that's being a little dramatic, let me explain...
                                    </p>
									<p>
                                        <figure>
                                            <span class="image right">
                                                <img src="images/HBC722_IMG_02.png" alt="" />
                                                <figcaption><font size="-1">A sequence of images showing FU Orionis dramatically flaring in brightness [credits: Hartmann & Kenyon <i>(1996)</i>]</font></figcaption>

                                        Logically, the stage in a star's life when they're mostly powered by infalling material should appear fairly stable when observed. In other words, since the material is falling onto the core at a somewhat constant rate, the light that is emitted as a result should be roughly constant as well. However, that was not the case when observing HBC722, which abruptly increased in brightness, for no apparent reason. To make matters worse, it's not the first time we've seen something like this occur, with HBC722 simply being the latest member of the club. These dozen or so objects are collectively referred to as FU Orionis objects (named after the star FU Orionis, which was the first time astronomers observed this exotic phenomenon).

									<h3>Not all hope is lost though</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Thankfully, the average astronomer is not as nihilistic as me; while I was busy scrubbing my brain of everything I'd learnt about star formation in retaliation (like that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpongeBobNauticalNonsense/videos/just-a-clever-visual-metaphor-spongebob/973552713017615/", target="_blank">one scene from Spongebob</a>), multiple hypotheses had already been proposed, explaining away these mysterious phenomena. The bad news? Most of them contradicted each other in some way. 
										<br>
										<br>
										To make a long story short, a lot of these theories made predictions about the mass of an FU Orionis object. Thus, if we could somehow measure their mass, we could make a better judgement call about which theory is the right one. And, well, you're reading an article about the story of HBC722, so obviously we're going to try and measure HBC722's mass.

									<h3>The first stumbling block</h3>
                                    <p>
										So how do we measure the mass of a star I hear you ask? Easy! We look at it, but like, super closely &#128064; (it's at this point I want to stress how bad of an idea looking directly at a star is, especially if that star rhymes with <i>bun</i>).
										<br>
										<br>
										But seriously though, astronomers have gotten so good at their job that simply looking at a star through a telescope is enough to determine how much mass is there! So what did we find when we observed HBC722 using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submillimeter_Array", target="_blank">Submillimeter Array</a> (SMA)? Absolutely nothing..
